  bodyText: 'By publishing articles, you can change some things in the world.


    1.
    MONEY

    You need money to survive. If this becomes zero, your newspaper can
    no longer function and you will be out of business. Make sure to keep this up!


    2.
    REACH

    The more people who read your paper, the more impact your news has
    on MONEY and ENVIRONMENT!


    3. ENVIRONMENT

    Your articles will change
    public perception! If this is too low, the public may not respect their environment.
    Keep this high to maintain environmental awareness and conservation efforts!'
