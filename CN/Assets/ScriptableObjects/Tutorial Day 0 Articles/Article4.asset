  bodyText: Be careful when choosing your articles. While some can help spread awareness
    to the public in a good way, they may hurt possible sponsorships or monetary
    business in turn. Also, remember that there are costs to running a newspaper
    and that the world won't wait for you; each week, you will lose some money and
    the environment will get worse so choose wisely!
