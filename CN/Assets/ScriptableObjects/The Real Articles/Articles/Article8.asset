  headline: 'Unprepared and at Risk: Local Schools Lacking in Severe Weather Safety
    Measures'
  bodyText: 'A recent survey conducted by the Green Herald has revealed a concerning
    lack of preparedness for severe weather events in schools across Palmer Springs,
    putting students and staff at potential risk.



    Despite frequent severe
    weather warnings last year, including tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, many
    local schools have outdated or non-existent safety protocols. The survey found
    that only 40% of schools have conducted severe weather drills in the past two
    years.



    "Ensuring the safety of our children should be a top priority,"
    said Emma Taylor, a parent and member of the school district''s safety committee.
    "Our schools need the resources and plans to handle these potentially life-threatening
    situations."



    The report has sparked a broader conversation about funding
    and priorities in school safety measures. School board officials have promised
    to review and update emergency preparedness protocols, a move welcomed by concerned
    parents and educators.'
